title: ðŸš€ Macbook Upgrade. First Impressions 
author: Alexandru Ilies

First of all, I will tell you how I started using the Apple ecosystem.

Back in 2013, when I was in my second year at the university, I got involved in an iOS internship. It was the first time I had ever used a macOS system, which was running on a Mac mini computer. I enjoyed using the system, and a few days after the internship started, I installed a Hackintosh version of Mavericks on my Asus notebook in order to use it at home and practice iOS development. The Hackintosh system ran pretty well, but the only problem I had was with the WiFi adapter, which was not supported, and I had to use a LAN cable every time. However, I was happy that I could learn iOS development without paying for an expensive Mac computer.

After the internship, I continued to use the Hackintosh system to work on some projects at the university. As a result, my experience and motivation to buy an Apple computer grew.
## My old MacBook 
-----
About 3 years later, in December 2016, I bought my first Apple computer. It was a MacBook Pro from 2015 with a 13-inch display, i7 3.1 GHz CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of SSD space. To be honest, it was my second computer, which I bought just a few days later than the first one. You can read why I made this decision on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Should-a-computer-science-student-get-a-13-or-15-inch-MacBook-Pro/answer/Alexandru-Ilie%C8%99?srid=SKYq).

This MacBook Pro was and still is a powerful computer, and it helped me to be more organized, efficient, and even happier in what I do.
## My new MacBook
----- 
I didn't have any essential reasons to upgrade my computer. It wasn't a burning desire, but then I created and advertised it on a local selling site two weeks ago. After that, someone wanted to buy it, and I wasn't prepared to part with it. I thought about keeping my old computer, but then I found an interesting advertisement. It wasn't a selling one, but a "changing" advertisement. The person who owned a MacBook Pro 2016 with touch bar, 13" display, 16 Gb of RAM, i7 3.3, and 512 Gb of SSD space wished to change it with the same configuration of MacBook Pro with a 15" display. I contacted him, and after a negotiation, he agreed to sell the computer to me. To be honest, it wasn't the best deal, and for a few hundred dollars more, I could have bought a more powerful MacBook Pro with a quad-core processor and a discrete GPU, but that's not what I wanted. The 13" display fit perfectly with my requirements. Even though the performance is lower than its 15" brother, it's still sufficient for my needs since I don't do any rendering or video gaming.

## What makes the difference
-----
I've seen many opinions regarding the new MacBook Pro computers. Some people are saying that the upgrade is not worth it if you already own a 2015 model. Others are saying that it is worth it, but there are some things they hate, like the touch bar, keyboard, performance (because of 32 GB of RAM), and so on. Here are my two cents on the differences I'm experiencing right now.

I've owned the described new computer for 4 days, and I did not expect to experience so many changes, but I am.

So, here are the things I love:

### The performance
The performance is really great. I should do some more PC experiments, but I saw the improvements when I built/rebuilt iOS applications. It takes considerably less time.
### The keyboard
I really love the new keyboard. It is so lovely to touch it and to write. I am more accurate doing this( using [QWERTY](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) writing style, without looking at the keyboard)
### The cooling system

With a new version of the processor and two cooling fans, plus some other improvements - the experience is awesome. While building iOS apps or other way stressing CPU tasks, the old computer's fan had up to 7000 rpm/minute. On a low-performance tasks, it was at 1500/2000 rpm/minute. 
    
On the new computer, the maximum rotation rate I registered was 2000 rpm/minute and you can't even hear them. The most interesting part, at low-performance tasks, it shows 0 rpm/minutes.

I really enjoy this improvement. I may say I have some allergy on fan sound because I hate it so much( I had some experience in the past with some desktop computer, but this is another story).

### The battery
Because of the cooling system, I think(of course and other stuff) the battery lasts for about - 7 hours. It is really enough for an entire workday.
    
### Touch bar
Here is really simple. I do not hate or love it. On the other hand, I find the Touch ID very useful. 
    
## Conclusion
-----
I think, generally, the upgrade is worth it. Especially for me, when thinking again about the cooling system.
