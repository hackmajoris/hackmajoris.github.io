title: Getting up a personal blog using Jekyll. 
author: Alexandru Ilies
---

In this post, I will provide a step by step tutorial regarding the process I used for getting up my blog. 
In the past, I had a personal website, hosted on a paid hosting. I paid for the hosting services about 40$ / year + about 35$ / year for a personal domain.

Now, with GitHub pages, it is much easier and cheaper(actually it costs you 0$) to set up a personal site/blog. Yes, you will not have a custom domain name but it is not so important for me (and maybe for you) now. The only thing which matters is the content and the content delivery process. 
 
 
## Introduction 

### What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a platform/feature provided by GitHub where users can host websites based on their GitHub repositories.
 
### What is Jekyll ?

Jekyll is a static sites generator tools, written in Ruby and it is the engine behind GitHub Pages platform.
 
## Installation and Configuration

### GitHub repository
In order to create a personal site/blog, first of all, you have to create a repository using this format: **your_github_username**.github.io
! It's enough to add in this repository a single **index.html** file, with some content, in order to see that the site up at https://**your_github_username**.github.io
That's all ðŸ™ƒ

Next, you will need to install Jekyll locally, if you want to do some changes regarding the theme layout.

### Jekyll install
The windows installation details can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).
 
I use a macOS system and here is how the installation process can be done:

```bash
~ gem install jekyll bundler
~ $ jekyll new my-awesome-site
~ $ cd my-awesome-site
~/my-awesome-site $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

Now you have a running Jekyll site, which has a predefined theme, which name is Minima (see how it looks -> [https://jekyll.github.io/minima/)](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/)

If you don't have in mind to build your own theme, you can select one from this list of official supported themes: [https://pages.github.com/themes/](https://pages.github.com/themes/), or, from this unofficial themes list: [https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme)

### General configuration
When you generate a new Jekyll project, you should find a **_config.yml** file in the project directory. It looks in this way:
 ```ruby
title: Your awesome title
author: GitHub User
email: your-email@domain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  jekyll
    
# Minima date format
# refer to http://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/ if you want to customize this
minima:
 date_format: "%b %-d, %Y"
    
# If you want to link only specific pages in your header, uncomment
# this and add the path to the pages in order as they should show up
#header_pages:
# - about.html
   
# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
theme: minima
exclude:
 - Gemfile
 - Gemfile.lock 
```
 
The configuration options are quite clear.
Here, in this configuration file, you can specify a theme. If you choose one from an officially supported theme, only you have to do is to modify the theme name in the theme variable. For example, if we choose [Hacker](https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/) theme:

```ruby
theme: jekyll-theme-hacker
```
    
You can see theme [documentation](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).
 
If you want to install an unofficial theme - follow the steps described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/).


 That's all. What is remaining, is to commit the changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
 
## Content delivery process

### Using VSCode
#### About Markdown 
In order to write posts, you have to take a look at how Markdown [syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) looks like.

"**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues."

At these step, you should agree that you need a markdown editor.

The [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is one of them.
You will need to install [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) plugin.

This is how it looks:

### Using AI Writer ðŸ˜»
Recently, I discovered [AI writer](https://ia.net/writer/). It is available only on MacOS and iOS, but...it's awesome. It costs some money, but it definitely worth them.

### [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com)
I am terrible at English.
