title: Macbook Upgrade. First Impressions 
author: Alexandru Ilies

First of all, I will tell how I started using Apple ecosystem.

Back in 2013, when I was in the second year at the university, I was involved in an iOS internship. I can say, it was the first time I touched a macOS(it was OSX system at that time) system, running on a Mac mini computer. 
I enjoyed using this system, and a few days after the internship started, I installed on my [Asus](https://www.asus.com/Laptops/N53SV/) notebook a Hackintosh version of Mavericks in order to use it at home, and practice iOS development. The Hackintosh system was running pretty well. The single problem I had, was the WiFi adapter, which was not supported and I had to plug in LAN cable every time. But of course, I was happy I was learning iOS development without paying money for an expensive Mac computer. 
After the internship, I continued to use Hackintosh in order to do some projects at the university. So, the experience and the motivation to buy an Apple computer was growing. 

## My old MacBook 
-----
About 3 years later, in December 2016, I bought the first Apple computer.
It was a MacBook Pro 2015 version, 13-inch display, i7 3.1 GHz CPU, 16 Gb of ram, 256 Gb of SSD space. (To be honest, it's a second computer, bought a few days later than the first one. [Read](https://www.quora.com/Should-a-computer-science-student-get-a-13-or-15-inch-MacBook-Pro/answer/Alexandru-Ilie%C8%99?srid=SKYq) why. 

It was and it is a powerful computer, and it helped me be more organized, more efficient in what I'm doing, and, why not - happier.

## My new MacBook
----- 
I did not have essential reasons to upgrade my computer. It was not a burning desire, however, I created and advertise on a local advertising site 2 weeks ago. So, after two weeks, someone wanted to buy my toy. I was like: brrrr...aaaa...I'm not ready... I guess I need to buy a new MacBook. I searched for a second hand, newer MacBook Pro, and found nothing interesting...
For a moment I thought keeping my old computer, but...then I found an interesting advertisement. I was not a selling one, that's why it didn't catch my attention the first time. It was a "changing" advertisement. The guy who owned that computer (MacBook Pro 2016 with touch bar, 13", 16 Gb of ram, i7 3.3, 512 Gb SSD space) wished to change it with the same configuration of MacBook Pro 15" display. I got in touch with him, and after a negotiation, he agreed to sell the computer. To be honest, it wasn't the best deal, with a few hundred dollars, I could buy the 15" inch MacBook Pro, which is more powerful because of the quad-core processor, and discrete GPU but it is not what I wanted. The 13" inch screen fitted perfectly my requirements. 
Yes, the performance is lower than his 15" brother, but I do not do any rendering or video gaming. 

## What makes the difference
-----
I saw many opinions regarding the new MacBook Pro computers.
Some people are saying the upgrade is not worth it if you own a 2015 model. Others are saying that it is worth but there are some things they hate, like the touch bar, keyboard, performance(because of 32 GB of ram) and so one.
I will write here my 50 cents regarding the differences I'm experiencing right now.

I own the described new computer for 4 days. I did not expect to experience so many changes, but I am. 

So, the things I love:

### The performance
The performance is really great. I should do some more PC experiments, but I saw the improvements when I built/rebuilt iOS applications. It takes considerably less time.
### The keyboard
I really love the new keyboard. It is so lovely to touch it and to write. I am more accurate doing this( using [QWERTY](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) writing style, without looking at the keyboard)
### The cooling system

With a new version of the processor and two cooling fans, plus some other improvements - the experience is awesome. While building iOS apps or other way stressing CPU tasks, the old computer's fan had up to 7000 rpm/minute. On a low-performance tasks, it was at 1500/2000 rpm/minute. 
    
On the new computer, the maxim ratation rate I registered was 2000 rpm/minute and you can't even hear them. The most interesting part, at low-performance tasks, it shows 0 rpm/minutes.

I really enjoy this improvement. I may say I have some allergy on fan sound because I hate it so much( I had some experience in the past with some desktop computer, but this is another story).

### The battery
Because of the cooling system, I think(of course and other stuff) the battery lasts for about - 7 hours. It is really enough for an entire workday.
    
### Touch bar
Here is really simple. I do not hate or love it. On the other hand, I find the Touch ID very useful. 
    
## Conclusion
-----
I think, generally, the upgrade is worth it. Especially for me, when thinking again about the cooling system.
